### Hello world! I’m Krista :wave:
### ハロー・ワールド！クリスタです

I love coding because I can make cool things, and enjoy the struggle of throwing myself into uncharted territory and the satisfaction of finding my way out.

In my spare time, you will find me playing games with friends, making music on my ukelele, or working out at the gym!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on finishing up my latest project, Note Pile, and building a portfolio site
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and data structures/algorithms
- 👯 I would love to collaborate on a new project- once my course is over, of course!

- ⚡ Fun fact: I lived in Tokyo and speak Japanese

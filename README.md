### Hello world! I’m Krista :wave:
### ハロー・ワールド！クリスタです

I love coding because I can make cool things, and enjoy the struggle of throwing myself into uncharted territory and the satisfaction of finding my way out.

In my spare time, you will find me playing games with friends, making music on my ukelele, or working out at the gym!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my first project, Nerdbrite, and am seeking employment opportunities
- 🌱 I’m currently studying data structures and algorithms
- 👯 I would love to collaborate on a new project!

- ⚡ Fun fact: I lived in Tokyo and speak Japanese

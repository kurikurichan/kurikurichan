### Hello world! I’m Krista :wave:
### ハロー・ワールド！クリスタです

I'm a passionate Full-Stack developer new to the scene and looking to make great things- a near survivor of App Academy's rigorous 6-month coding bootcamp. I love coding because I can make cool things, and enjoy the struggle of throwing myself into uncharted territory and the satisfaction of finding my way out.

In my spare time, you will find me playing games with friends, making music on my ukelele, or working out at the gym!
	
- 🔭 I’m currently working on finishing up my latest project, Note Pile, and building a portfolio site
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and how to use React-Quill
- 👯 I would love to collaborate on a new project- once my course is over, of course!

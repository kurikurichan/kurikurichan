### Hello world! I’m Krista :wave:
### ハロー・ワールド！クリスタです

Hey! I'm Krista Strucke. I'm a passionate Full-Stack developer new to the scene and looking to make great things. I love to code in my free time. I live for the struggle of throwing myself into uncharted territory and  the satisfaction of finding my way out.
In my spare time, you will find me at the gym, pumping the irons or playing with DND group!


💪 I’m currently working on GRADUATING APP ACADEMY!
🌱 I’m currently learning about React and Flask
👯 Let me know if you'd like to collaborate on something
⚡ Fun fact: I lived in Tokyo and speak Japanese
